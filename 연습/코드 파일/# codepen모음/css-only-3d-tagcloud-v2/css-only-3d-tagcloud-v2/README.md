# CSS Only 3D Tagcloud V2

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/xxeBMZb](https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/xxeBMZb).

A 3D tagcloud that works completely without JavaScript.

You can control the direction of rotation of the tag cloud by clicking outside the tag cloud. The direction of rotation depends on where you click.

If you want to change the appearance, change the values of the CSS variables. 

Adding new tags is very easy. Simply create a new li tag in ul. It is important to set the variable --index and to update the variable --num-elements in the ul, i.e. the tagcloud, accordingly.
