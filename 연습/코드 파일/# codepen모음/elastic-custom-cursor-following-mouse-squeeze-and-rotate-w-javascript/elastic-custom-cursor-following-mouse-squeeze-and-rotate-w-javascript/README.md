# Elastic Custom Cursor Following Mouse (Squeeze and Rotate) w/ JavaScript

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/gusevdigital/pen/MWxyXRa](https://codepen.io/gusevdigital/pen/MWxyXRa).

Here I've created an elastic circle that follows your mouse cursor. This is achieved by calculating the velocity and direction of the mouse movement, and then dynamically adjusting the 'transform' property to reflect these changes.
