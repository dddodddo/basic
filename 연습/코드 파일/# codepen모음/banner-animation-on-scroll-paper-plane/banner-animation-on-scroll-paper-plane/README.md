# Banner animation on scroll (paper plane)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/gOJbOpO](https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/gOJbOpO).

In this codepen a paper plane will fly through the sections as you scroll down. It just seems like that but the main idea here is GSAP ScrollMagic. This gives really soothing and subtle effect to your webpage and makes users "want to stay" on your website along with enhancing the user experience.
