# GSAP custom cursor and filtered backdrops

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/gwuliano/pen/VwOLzra](https://codepen.io/gwuliano/pen/VwOLzra).

Custom cursor that scales when hovered with text and lets a very colorful and distorted view come through. A cool way to hover over buttons too. GSAP is used for some of the animations!
