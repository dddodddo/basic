# (ㅅㅇ)Play Button Mouse Follow in video

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/mdoKjpE](https://codepen.io/suuneee/pen/mdoKjpE).

This a pen that showcases a play button that follows the cursor when it hovers over the video. You can enter a video URL and pause or play to experiment with it.

I made it for the CodePen challenge, but you can follow my comments to see which parts are optional and which parts are the main codes for the play button and video container.

PS. Sorry if you got rickrolled. ;)
