# JavaScript Filters Challenge: Enhanced Beverage Menu

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/httgyxiw-the-sans/pen/pomyeKr](https://codepen.io/httgyxiw-the-sans/pen/pomyeKr).

This project demonstrates the use of the JavaScript .filter() method to create an interactive beverage menu. Users can filter the list to show only decaf or caffeinated drinks using buttons. This example builds on CodePen's starter template, enhancing it with additional functionality and styling.
