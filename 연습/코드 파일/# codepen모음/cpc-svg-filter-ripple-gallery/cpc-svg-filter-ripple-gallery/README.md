# [cpc] SVG filter rIpple gallery

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/cbolson/pen/jOobxwG](https://codepen.io/cbolson/pen/jOobxwG).

An attempt to use an SVG filter to create a ripple effect on the images as they fade in and out.

Try as I might I have not been able to resolve the slight jump at the end of the animatiom.
If anybody has a solution I would love to hear it. Thanks.
